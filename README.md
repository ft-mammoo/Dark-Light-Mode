# 🌗 Dark-Light Mode Toggle

A simple JavaScript project to toggle between dark and light themes using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. Built as part of a 90-day frontend sprint to strengthen DOM manipulation skills.

## 🚀 Features

- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Clean and responsive design
- Toggle state persists visually across clicks
- Minimal and efficient codebase

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla DOM manipulation)

## 📂 File Structure

```
Dark-Light-Mode/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

## 🎯 How It Works

- A button toggles a `dark-mode` class on the `<body>`.
- CSS styles change based on this class.
- JS handles class toggling via `classList.toggle()`.

 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ft-mammoo/Dark-Light-Mode.git
